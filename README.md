This is a real-time live chat website where users can chat with others who appear on the map. It’s designed like a game—users can move their character up, down, left, and right. When two players come within a certain range of each other, they can start a conversation.

The platform supports multiple chats, allowing users to have conversations with several players at once. Users can also edit their name and customize their character.

When a user quits the game, all chats are deleted. However, if the user stays in the game, they can choose to end any specific chat manually.

I built this using TypeScript, React, and Vite on the frontend, and Node.js with Socket.IO on the backend to handle real-time communication.

One of the main challenges I faced during this project was related to Socket.IO connections and real-time updates. I overcame these issues through research and experimentation.
